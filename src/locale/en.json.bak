  "KEY_AGENT_TEACH_EXAMPLE_DETAIL": "The site's commission is based on valid bets. Let's assume the site's commission for bets between 100k and 200k is 80 per 10k, and for bets of 3 million or more, it's 160 per 10k. A was the first to spot an opportunity on this site and quickly recruited B1, B2, and B3. B1 subsequently recruited C1 and C2, B2 has no subordinates, and B3 recruited only the formidable C3.\n\nA few days later:\n\nB1 placed valid bets of 120k.\nB2 placed valid bets of 40k.\nB3 placed valid bets of 20k.\nC1 placed valid bets of 100k.\nC2 placed valid bets of 30k.\nC3 placed valid bets of 3 million.\nAs a result, B1's total performance from C1 and C2 is 130k, with a commission rate of 80 per 10k. B2, having no subordinates, has a performance of 0. B3, however, performed exceptionally well thanks to C3, amassing a total of 3 million at a commission rate of 160 per 10k. A has a direct performance of 180k and an additional team performance of 3.13 million, amounting to 3.31 million at a commission rate of 160 per 10k.\n\nHere's the earnings breakdown:\n\nDirect Team: Refers to members directly recruited, collectively termed the direct team.\n(1) B1, B2, and B3's contribution to A: (120k + 40k + 20k) x 160/10k = 2880.\n(2) C1 and C2's contribution to B1: (100k + 30k) x 80/10k = 1040.\n(3) C3's contribution to B3: 3 million x 160/10k = 48,000.\n\nOther Teams: Refers to members brought in by subordinates, like second-tier, third-tier members, and so on. Given that this system can endlessly develop subordinates, for simplicity, only a two-tier structure is illustrated here.\n(1) From C1 and C2 to A: As B1's total performance stands at 130k with a commission rate of 80/10k, and A's total performance is 3.31 million at a rate of 160/10k, there's a commission rate difference between A and B1 of 80 per 10k. This rate difference is what C1 and C2 contribute to A. Hence, their contribution is (100k + 30k) x 80/10k = 1040.\n(2) From C3 to A: Given that B3's performance totals 3 million and A's is 3.31 million, both benefiting from a commission rate of 160/10k, there's no commission rate difference between them. This means C3's contribution to A is 3 million x 0/10k = 0.\n\nIn summary:\n(1) C3's efficiency ensures that all of A's activities benefit from a higher commission rate.\n(2) B2, having not recruited any members, thus earns nothing.\n(3) Even though B3 joined later and is under A, thanks to the efficiency of C3, he directly benefits from a higher commission rate. Consequently, B3's earnings are unaffected by his joining date or his tier, and he's not disadvantaged by the performance of others' recruits.\n(4) This represents a truly equitable agency model. Latecomers aren't perpetually at a disadvantage.",
